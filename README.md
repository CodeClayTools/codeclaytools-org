# 🏺 CodeClayTools

**CodeClayTools** is a collection of handcrafted, open-source tools built for developers, tinkerers, sysadmins, and curious minds. This organization serves as the home for small but focused projects—each with a clear purpose, zero bloat, and maximum clarity.

## 📐 Philosophy

We build:
- Small, focused tools
- That are self-contained and easy to understand
- With logs, errors, and respect for your system

We don't do:
- Ads
- Analytics
- Unclear licensing
- Anything requiring trust in the cloud

## 🤝 Contributing

Coming soon: once the first tools are published and documented, contributions will be welcome.
For now, follow progress and test out what’s there.
